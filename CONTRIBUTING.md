## Issues
When creating an issue, please select from one of the pre-made issue templates to help speed up the process of identifying what needs to be done. If your issue is not listed in the template list, select "other". Please try and make issues focus on 1 unique thing, and make multiple issues for multiple things.

### Reporting Bugs
When reporting bugs, please make sure to include supplemental information like tracebacks and logs where applicable to help identify the issue quicker. 

### Feature Requests
When creating an feature request, check previous feature requests to ensure it is not a duplicate. If it has been a while since the last feature request was made, and you believe circumstances have changed since the last one was handled - feel free to make a new request.

### Documentation
When making changes to the documentation, please ensure everything is spelt correctly and makes grammatical sense. All of the documentation should be clean & to the point possible, including images & code snippets where needed. 

### Code Changes & Pull Requests
By contributing to the project, you are happy to license your work under the repository [LICENSE](./LICENSE). All commits should follow the commit convention which can be found [here](.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md). Pull requests should be descriptive to the changes they make, and should reference any issues they relate to with tags like `closes` or `fixes`.

Husky has been set-up for pre-push checks to ensure code quality, pull requests will only be merged if they pass all checks and have been reviewed. You can find all the test scripts in the [package.json](./package.json).
